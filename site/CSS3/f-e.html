   <div id=lecture1>Lecture 1: Pop-ups</div>
   To add an alert when you click on particular content, you have to add the onclick attribute to the tag for the contnent and then put alert, and your mesage in quotes within parentheses. Like this. <img src="alert.png" width="238" height="18" alt="Alert">
   <div onclick="alert('IT WORKS');">
   When you click on this sentence, an alert will appear confirming it works.</div>

   <div class="clear">You can remove the bullet points of numbers from lists by adding attributes to the tag itself, or to the stylesheet. I have done so in the navigation bar where there are links to areas of the page. It is actually a list, but because I have removed the bullet points, you can't tell the difference.

   <div id=lecture8>Lecture 8: Character Entity References</div>
   <div class="notes"> Note: For some reason, I don't need to add a semi-colon for some Entities to show, that why I have enclosed the words in brackets
   </div>
   <p>There are 3 characters that should always be escaped. They are (&lt;), (&gt;) and (&amp;).
   </p>
   To show these as text you must type in <img src="lessthan.png" width="40" height="18" alt="Less than">, <img src="greaterthan.png" width="40" height="18" alt="Greater than">, <img src="ampersand.png" width="43" height="18" alt="Ampersand"> respectively.<!--I didn't type the semi-colon itself because it will turn into the entity.-->
   <p>Other example of Entity References:
    <span class="examples"><br>(&copy;): <img src="copyright.png" width="50" height="18" alt="Copyright"><span class="examples">(&quot;): <img src="quotes.png" width="45" height="18" alt="Quotes"></span>
   </span>
   </p>
   You can also stop text wrapping when a window is made smaller by using <img src="nobreakspace.png" width="50" height="18" alt="No break space">. I've typed a long sentence so that I can show how to prevent broken words. <br>The set of unbroken words that I am going to use as an example is my full name.

      <div id=lecture9>Lecture 9: Creating Links</div>
      Internal links are links to a file in the same directory as the file that is being edited. <a href="blank.html" target="_blank" title="Blank Page">Like this.</a>
      <div>If you want the link to be on a different line, you can surround the text in div tags.
      <a href="blank.html" target="_blank" title="Blank Page">
       <div>Like this.</div>
      </a>
      </div>
      <p>
      External links are links to a file that is not in the same directory. <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs" target="_blank" title="Git References">Like this.</a>
      </p>
      Same page links are links to an area in the same page. Examples of this are shown with the links at the top of the page to each lecture. Also it should be noted that if you want a link to open in a new page or tab, you must _blank in a target attribute. <img src="target_blank.png" width="111" height="18" alt="Target blank">

 <section>
      <div id=lecture10>Lecture 10: Displaying Images</div>
      To display an image you use the 'img' tag.
      <div>
        <img src="puppyimg.png" width="472" height="56" alt="Image Tag example">
      </div>
      <p>It's an inline tag so as shown above, if you want the image on it's own line you need to contain the image in a blockline tag. I have used 'div' tags as my blockline tags. Below you will see that the text 'Here's a picture of a puppy.' are right next to the image on the same line, and this is proof of the 'img' tag being an inline one.
        </p>
      <div>
      <img src="puppy.jpg" width="320" height="200" alt="A puppy"> Here's a picture of a puppy.
      </div>

    <div id=lecture13>Lectures 13 & 14: Element, Class and ID Selectors</div>
    You can style an element by simply writing the name of the element and then write the styles you want in a pair of braces.<img src="element.png" width="45" height="18" alt="Element">
    <p>You can style a class by writing a fullstop, the name of the class with no spaces and then write the styles you want in a pair of braces.<img src="class.png" width="50" height="18" alt="Class">
    </p>
    <div>You can style an ID by writing a pound sign, the name of the ID with no spaces and then write the styles you want in a pair of braces.<img src="ID.png" width="80" height="18" alt="ID"></div>
    <p><div>I have shown the use of using selectors to style my webpage in the stylesheet. For example I gave made all the text on this page Trebuchet MS.</div>
    <img src="bodyfont.png" width="370" height="70" alt="Body font">  
    </p>
    <div>You can style several selectors in the same way by separating them with commas. </div>
    <img src="multipleselectors.png" width="150" height="60" alt="Multiple selectors"> 
    <p>Selectors can also be combined, they don't have to be used individually. There are 5 different ways to combine selectors that I currently know of. 
    </p>
    <section class=combiningselectors> <!--I'm going to split this into 6 columns
      ALSO I HAVE TO EDIT FROM HERE DOWNWARDS-->
      <span></span>
      <div><span>Element with a class selector</span>
        <br>To do this, you simply type in the name of the element followed by a fullstop and then name of the class without spaces in between. 
        <p>An example is shown below:
        <br><img src="elementwithclassselector.png" width="182" height="56" alt="Element with Class Selector">
        <br>This means that every 'span' element that is classed as examples will have a 40px left margin.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div><span>Direct child selector</span>
        <br>The direct child inside the parent will be affected. Not all descendants, just the ones that are directly inside the parent. 
        <p>An example is shown below:
        <br><img src="directchildselector.png" width="142" height="56" alt="Direct Child Selector">
        <br>This means that every 'p' element that is a direct child of an article will be blue. A 'p' tag within a 'div' tag that is within an 'article' tag, will not be affected.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div><span>Descendant selector</span>
        <br>Is the exact same as the direct child selector, except for the fact that it also includes any of the tags that are also not direct child.
        <p>An example is shown below:
        <br><img src="descendantselector.png" width="170" height="56" alt="Descendant Selector">
        <br>This means that any 'p' elements that are within the 'article' element will have the font size of 24px.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div><span>Adjacent sibling selector</span>
        <br>This is used to affect selectors that are next to each other. You use the '+' to connect selectors.
        <p>An example is shown below:
        <br><img src="adjacentsiblingselector.png" width="222" height="56" alt="Adjacent Sibling Selector">
        <br>This means that any 'p' tag that directly follows a 'p' tag will have a yellow backfground. The first p itself is not affected.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div><span>General sibling selector</span>
        <br>To do this, you use the '~' to connect selectors. This means that all the siblings within the same parent will have certain attributes.
        <p>An example is shown below:
        <br><img src="generalsiblingselector.png" width="248" height="64" alt="General Sibling Selector">
        <br>This means that any 'p' elements with the same parent 'div' element will be underlined.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <p class=clear>All of this can be applied to different selectors and can be mixed. It doesn't have to be with element to element only.
    </p>
    I have actually combined selectors myself by using <img src="nthchild.png" width="180" height="18" alt="nth-child selector"> in my stylesheet.
    <div>This helps me style every lecture title the way I want to because it is alwys the 1st div in every section that I have created.</div>
 </section>

 <section>
    <div id=lecture15>Lecture 15: Pseudo-class Selectors</div>
    <div>There are also pseudo-class selectors which work based on the way the user interacts with the webpage. The pseudo-class refers to the current state of particlar content. To use one, you add a semi-colon after the selector and then the pseudo-class. Here are examples of a few:
    <div><img src="pseudoclassselector.png" width="300" height="54" alt="Pseudo-class selector"></div>
    <p>The ':link' one is a link in its natural state before it has been clicked on. ':visited' is a link that has been clicked on before. ':hover' is a link that is being hovered on. ':active' is a link that is being clicked on. ':nth&nbsp;-&nbsp;child(1~/odd/even)' is a particular child within the selector chosen. You can have any number child, or you coud put every even or odd child.
    </p>
    </div>

 </section>

 <section>
    <div id=lecture16>Lecture 16 & 18: Style Placement & Styling Text</div>
    <div>
      You can style text directly inside the necessary html, but it is more common practice to use a css stylesheet and then provide a link to it in the html.
      <div>
        <img src="linkingstylesheet.png" width="272" height="21" alt="Link to stylesheet">
      </div> 
      <p>Remember that styling attributes work in a chronological order. So the lower it is in the html, the higher precedent it takes. (This obviously disregarding the rule of specificity.) This is why you place the link to the stylesheet inside the head area, as this means you have virtually added all your styles there.
